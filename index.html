				Welcome to Wicca.Pedia, the one and only place where you can recieve the cold hard facts not limited by the government or news that LIES TO YOU. Here you’ll find nothing but the truth, everything written here is meant to open your eyes to the world around you. Facts: Vaccines and ChemTrails are the government’s way of tring to control your mind, Kubrick helped the US “Government” fake the moon landing to fake out the Ruskies, and MONSTERS ARE REAL AND THEY’RE EVERYWHERE OKAY? 
				<br>
				<br>
				About me: 
				Name is HACKMAN. I work for a government organization that helps protect the public from monsters, but it also aims to inform the public about the truth. Before, I mostly stuck to OTHER ONLINE FORUMS who BANNED ME for trying to EXPOSE THE TRUTH. Now, I travel with other people who work for the order, including my brother George who works directly for them. There’s also like an old professor, a witch, a monster, and some kid with some problems. If you ever hear of someone stopping monsters, you know who to thank. 
				<br>
				<br>
				This website is meant to record all the instances of supernatural I come across, to keep you the readers informed on what you should be afraid of. The public deserves to know what dangers there are in this fucked up world, and it’s my job to meet those dangers head on with my fucking 12 gague. If you have any questions, email me at my screenname: 1337HACKMAN@hotmail.com

				Yep, just another day of saving the asses of some kids who don’t give a shit about nothing but their phones and porn. Back in my day if we wanted to talk to our friends, we’d have to walk over to their house, and if we wanted to watch porn we’d need to buy a magazine subscription or have a hell of a good imagination. I always had the latter, but not for wackin it to bimbos, but of the truth. George was always a cynic growing up, he never believed shit. He didn’t believe our 3rd grade teacher was a martian until I proved that to be right (but he still doesn’t believe me). 
    			<br>
    			<br>
			    So today we got a call that some frat DOUCHE was found dead outside his window. Bradford Banks was waiting at the crimescene, he’s our guy that kinda knows what we’re up to. I tell the other officers we’re monster hunters too but they never seem to remember. It wouldn’t seem like monsters would be behind this one but the truth can often be decieving. 
				<br>
				<br>
				This shit, Lewis Buckner, was flung maybe 100 feet from his fucking window, more than just a fall. There was also some frost on him, which is a ghost thing if you haven’t read my blog before. We talked to his girlfriend, she said there was some creature stalking him. We get his phone and apparently he was shaggin some chick on the side and then blew her off after he got the goods. Us hanging outside get word that another body fell out of a window. We load up Lewis’s body into the van (It’s disguised as a flower shop called Pushin Up Daisies. If you ever see it knock on the window and we can talk about whatever theories you want. Paul McCartney clone, JFK murder, the Globalists, you name it) and we head over to the fresh crimescene.	
				<br>
				<br>
				We find the new victim, the sidechick, Shelly Young. Same shit, broken glass, body flung far, frost. Her roommate who is already someone who knows about monsters says it was a spirit. Shelly apparently was trying to conjure some ghost to get rid of Lewis’s girlfriend so they could ram again. She fucked up big time and summoned something else entirely. The thing she summoned was what we now know to be a dormant spirit, stuck at the college. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We tracked down the spirit to the McDowel Building. This thing was mad as all shit. I shot at it but it didn’t work, and the thing started sucking my energy. I put out a message on the forums about anyone on campus that could help us contain this thing for the time being (thanks to Julius_is_cooliest for coming to help). George and I drive across campus to pick him up and we load him in. I wasn’t wearing my seatbelt because no damn whimp politician is gonna tell me what to do in my own damn car so I fell out the window, snapped my leg all good. We drove back to McDowel, got the spirit contained for the time being. 
				<br>
				<br>
				While we were driving, the others found out that this spirit (named Evelyn) was an old flame of a professor who was married. Apparenly Ephraim, the professor with us, knew this guy from back when. We headed to this guys house, while James from the organization was going to meet us there for an exorcism. The old flame, Eric, was at his house. He was none too pleased about us arriving but he’s the dumbass who boinked a student so tough luck. We performed that exorcism, and the spirit ditched but took Eric along with. His family walked in right after. They’re pretty pissed, but that’s just what the truth does sometimes. The truth can hurt, can make you angry, but you have a right to know it.

				Basically, it was just another day in the life of HACKMAN.
